### Answers 

There are three observable trends when you have the ```HeroesOfPymoli```.

First, as you can see at the table below, there is a major presence of Male players, representing 84.03% of the total players.

Gender | Count	| Percentage of Players
---| ---| --- 
Male	| 484	| 84.03%
Female	| 81	| 14.06%
Other / Non-Disclosed	| 11	| 1.91%

Second, we already know about the major presence of Male players, but, No-male players has a tendency to buy more (Average Purchase Total per Person) which indicates a good opportunity to market the game aiming for more Non-Male players, in order to increase revenue with items.
    
| Gender 				|Total Users	|Purchase Count		|Average Purchase Price	 |Total Purchase Value	|Average Purchase Total per Person |
|-----------------------|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Female				|81				|113				|\\$3.20					 |\\$361.94				|\\$4.47                           |
| Male					|484			|652				|\\$3.02					 |\\$1,967.64				|\\$4.07                           |
| Other / Non-Disclosed	|11				|15					|\\$3.35					 |\\$50.19				|\\$4.56                           |

And last, but not least, there is a huge concentration of players within a 15-30 years old range, which indicates a good opportunity to narrow the marketing srategy, focusing on increasing revenue.

|Age Group 		| Total Users	| Percentage of Players|
|---------------|:-------------:|:--------------------:|
|from 0 to 5 	| 0 			| 0.00%              |
|from 5 to 10 	| 24 			| 4.17%              |
|from 10 to 15 	| 41 			| 7.12%              |
|from 15 to 20 	| 150 			| 26.04%             |
|from 20 to 25 	| 232 			| 40.28%             |
|from 25 to 30 	| 59 			| 10.24%             |
|from 30 to 35 	| 37			| 6.42%              |
|from 35 to 40 	| 26 			| 4.51%              |
|from 40 to 45 	| 7 			| 1.22%              |
